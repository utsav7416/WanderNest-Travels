# Home Rentals Application

A comprehensive full-stack MERN application designed for renting and listing properties. This application offers a seamless user experience for both property owners and renters. Property owners can create listings with detailed information, upload photos, and set availability via a calendar. Renters can search, filter, book properties, and manage favorites in a wishlist.
